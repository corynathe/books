            <p>It was a sunny Saturday morning, and Grayson was so excited. He was five years old, and today was the
                day of his big basketball game! He had been practicing his dribbling, layups, and passing with his dad
                all week. He just knew he was going to be a star player.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="page-padding">
            <p>When Grayson got to the gym, he put on his shiny blue jersey and joined his team on the court. The
                game started, and right away, something didn’t feel right. The other team was scoring lots of points,
                and his team was having trouble keeping up.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>Grayson frowned. "This isn’t fair!" he said to himself. He missed a pass and stomped his foot.
                "They have all the good players!" he muttered as he walked back to the middle of the court.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>A few minutes later, Grayson missed another shot. He looked at the referee and shouted, “That
                was a foul!” He threw his hands in the air, feeling really upset.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>Coach Carter, a kind and wise man with a gray beard and twinkling eyes, noticed Grayson’s frustration.
                During the next time-out, he gently called Grayson over to the bench.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="page-padding">
            <p>“Grayson, why don’t you come sit with me for a minute?” Coach Carter said, resting a hand on
                Grayson's shoulder.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>Grayson slumped down on the bench. "Coach, this game isn’t fair. The other team is too good, and the
                refs aren’t calling the fouls right. I keep messing up!"</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>Coach Carter nodded and smiled softly. "I see you're upset, buddy. But let me tell you something
                really important, okay?"</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>Grayson looked up, curious.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>“Sometimes, things won’t go our way in games, or even in life. But complaining won’t help us or our
                team. It just makes us more upset. What really matters is staying calm and being a good teammate."</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="page-padding">
            <p>Grayson blinked. "But Coach, the other team has all the best players."</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>Coach Carter chuckled. "Maybe it feels that way, but basketball isn’t just about having the best
                players. It's about working together. Everyone has strengths. You may not score every basket, but
                you can help your team in other ways—by passing, cheering, or playing good defense.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>And when we stay calm and kind, even when the game feels unfair, that’s how we show we're true team players."</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>Grayson thought about that for a moment. "But the refs are making bad calls," he said quietly.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="page-padding">
            <p>Coach Carter nodded again. "Sometimes, it might feel like the refs miss things. But they're doing
                their best, just like you are. The best thing we can do is respect them and keep playing. Being
                kind to the referees shows that you can handle tough situations with grace. And remember, it's not
                just about winning the game. It's about having fun, learning, and growing as a person. That’s the
                real victory."</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>Grayson took a deep breath. "So... even if the game doesn’t seem fair, I should still try my best
                and help my team?"</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>"Exactly," Coach Carter said, smiling wide. "Because when you work together, lift each other up, and
                stay positive, that’s how you become a winner in life. The scoreboard doesn’t always show the most
                important victories."</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>Grayson felt a little better. "Okay, Coach. I’ll try to be a better teammate."</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="page-padding">
            <p>Coach Carter patted him on the back. "I know you will. Now, get out there and show your team what
                being a great teammate looks like!"</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>Grayson jumped off the bench with a big smile. He ran back onto the court, ready to play again.
                This time, he didn’t worry about whether the teams were fair. Instead, he focused on passing the
                ball, encouraging his teammates, and playing his best.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>And you know what? His team started to do better! They might not have won that day, but Grayson felt
                proud. He had fun, worked with his team, and learned that being kind and a good teammate is more
                important than anything else.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>As he high-fived his friends at the end of the game, Grayson knew that he had won something much
                bigger than just points on a scoreboard.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="page-padding">
            <p>And from that day on, Grayson played every game with a big smile, a calm heart, and a spirit of teamwork.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>The end.</p>
