            <p>One chilly afternoon, two best friends—Boston and Bob—were playing basketball in their backyard. Boston, who was as bright yellow as a sunny day, dribbled the ball with impressive flair. Bob, who was very short but full of energy, jumped and dribbled just as fast, even though the ball sometimes bounced higher than him!</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>"Give me three!" Bob shouted, laughing as he took a shot and missed by a mile.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>"Give me three!" Boston replied, sending the ball flying straight into the hoop. "Your turn, Bob!"</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>But today, their game would take a strange turn. While retrieving the ball from the bushes, Bob spotted something hidden beneath the leaves: an old, crinkled map.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>"Hey, Boston! Look what I found!" Bob said, pulling the map out and squinting at it.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="page-padding">
            <p>Boston bounced over, his yellow skin almost glowing. "Whoa, it looks like a treasure map! But... what’s this about a Candy Cane Forest?"</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>Bob adjusted his tiny glasses. "It says here there's a legendary forest full of peppermint trolls, chocolate fountains, and... a snowflake fairy who needs help saving the forest! We have to go find it!"</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>Boston grinned. "Adventure time! Let's go solve the mystery!"</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>With the map in hand, the duo set off toward the unknown. As they walked, they dribbled the basketball down the path, jumping over logs and dodging tree branches. "Give me three!" Bob yelled, dribbling around a rock.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="page-padding">
            <p>"Give me three!" Boston responded, jumping to avoid a low-hanging branch. "This is way more fun than I thought!"</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>Soon, they found themselves deep in the forest, where the trees sparkled like sugar crystals, and the air smelled of peppermint. But things weren’t as sweet as they seemed. A group of peppermint trolls appeared, blocking their path. They had green faces, pointy ears, and were munching on candy cane sticks.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>“Uh-oh! What do we do?” Bob whispered, standing on tiptoe to try to peek over a bush.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>“I’ve got an idea!” Boston shouted. “We use the candy canes!”</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="page-padding">
            <p>Bob looked at him, confused. “The candy canes?”</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>Boston grinned. “Watch this!”</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>He tossed a candy cane in the air, and as it spun, it landed perfectly between the trolls. The trolls stopped, eyeing the candy cane with great interest.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>“You think this is some kind of candy cane competition?” Bob asked, dribbling the basketball.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>“Maybe,” Boston said with a wink. “But I have a plan. You ready?”</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>Bob nodded, and the two friends shouted in unison, “Give me three!” They bounced the basketball between their feet and dribbled circles around the trolls, who became so distracted by the candy cane they completely forgot to stop them.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="page-padding">
            <p>As they continued their way through the forest, they reached a giant chocolate fountain, bubbling and splashing like a river of gooey sweetness. Suddenly, the ground shook, and out of the chocolate burst a giant snowflake fairy, her wings shimmering like icicles.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>“Help! The forest is in danger!” the fairy cried. “The trolls have taken all the candy canes, and now the forest is starting to melt!”</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>Boston and Bob looked at each other. “Time to get those candy canes back!” Bob said.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>With the snowflake fairy flying above them, the friends ran toward the trolls’ hideout, dribbling the basketball and jumping over chocolate puddles. They found the trolls sitting around a huge pile of stolen candy canes.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="page-padding">
            <p>“We need those back!” Boston said.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>The trolls, still holding their candy canes, looked up in surprise. “Why should we give them back?” one troll grumbled.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>“Because we need them to save the forest!” Bob explained.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>The trolls scratched their heads. “Hmm, maybe if you can beat us at basketball, we’ll give them back!” one troll challenged.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>Boston grinned. “You’re on! Give me three!”</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="page-padding">
            <p>With a loud, “Give me three!” Bob tossed the basketball toward Boston, and the game began. The trolls dribbled clumsily, but the two friends worked together, jumping and dribbling in perfect harmony. Boston made an amazing shot, and the trolls, out of breath from laughing so hard, agreed to give the candy canes back.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>The snowflake fairy sprinkled some magical snow over the candy canes, and with a flash, the forest was saved! The trees sparkled even brighter, and the air smelled even sweeter.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>“You did it!” the snowflake fairy cheered. “The forest is safe thanks to you!”</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>Bob high-fived Boston. “All in a day’s work. Give me three!”</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="page-padding">
            <p>Boston laughed. “Give me three!” And together, they walked back home, their hearts full of adventure—and maybe just a little bit of chocolate.</p>
