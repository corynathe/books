            <p>It was the day before Christmas Eve, and something very strange was happening at the North Pole. Santa’s workshop was buzzing with activity, but George, the oddest elf you could ever meet, was looking particularly puzzled. He had glasses that were too big for his face, and his ears stuck out like two little candy canes.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>“I’ve just checked the Naughty List, Cindy Loo Hoo,” George said in his usual odd voice, his eyes wide. “Something’s wrong!”</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>Cindy Loo Hoo, the funniest elf at the North Pole, came skipping over. She had her bright red hat on crooked and was twirling a snowflake in the air with one hand while balancing a plate of cookies in the other.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>“What do you mean something’s wrong, George? Is there an elf on the shelf causing trouble?” Cindy Loo Hoo asked, giggling.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="page-padding">
            <p>George looked at her seriously. “It’s not an elf on the shelf. Someone has tampered with Santa’s Naughty List! A lot of good kids are suddenly on the naughty list, and some naughty kids are mysteriously on the nice list.”</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>Cindy Loo Hoo gasped. “That’s the worst thing ever! If we don’t fix it, no one will get presents, and Christmas will be ruined!”</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>“No pressure, huh?” George muttered, scratching his head. “We need to solve this mystery before the big day. If we don’t fix it soon, Santa might not be able to deliver gifts!”</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>Cindy Loo Hoo stood up straight. “Don’t worry, George. We’re a team, and we’ve got this. First, we need to think like detectives. What do detectives eat while solving mysteries?”</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="page-padding">
            <p>George blinked. “I don’t know… popcorn?”</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>“Nope! They eat McDonald's Friend Fries and chocolate milk!” Cindy Loo Hoo declared, her voice full of excitement. “That’s the detective snack of champions!”</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>“Uh… okay, I guess we can try that,” George agreed, even though he wasn’t sure what was so special about the snack.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>The two friends raced to the North Pole McDonald’s (yes, there was one there—it was a magical place). After munching on the fries and drinking the chocolate milk, they were suddenly filled with energy, and their giggles started bubbling up.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>“Okay, let’s get back to the list,” Cindy Loo Hoo said, trying to stay serious, but her giggling made her voice squeaky. “We have to figure out who did this.”</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="page-padding">
            <p>As they danced and laughed their way back to Santa’s office, George noticed something. “Wait! The Naughty List looks a little… soggy,” he said, pointing to the papers on Santa’s desk.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>“Uh-oh, the list got wet!” Cindy Loo Hoo said, squinting at the soggy paper. “I bet that’s why the names are all mixed up!”</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>But just then, the ground shook, and a little elf—named Bob—rushed in, holding a bucket of snowballs. “I know what happened!” Bob shouted, his face serious.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>“You do?” George and Cindy Loo Hoo asked in unison.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>“Yep! Someone used their snowball fight skills to mess with the list!” Bob explained. “They soaked the paper with snow, erased names, and added their own!”</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="page-padding">
            <p>Cindy Loo Hoo gasped. “Who would do such a thing?”</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>George frowned. “Wait a minute… I have a theory. What if—?”</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>Before he could finish, the workshop door swung open, and a jolly voice boomed. “Ho, ho, ho! What’s all the laughter about in here?”</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>It was Santa!</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>Cindy Loo Hoo and George turned to Santa, grinning. “Santa!” they said together. “We’ve solved the mystery!”</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>“Sha-booya!” they both yelled in excitement.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="page-padding">
            <p>Santa chuckled. “Sha-booya indeed! So, who’s been tampering with my list?”</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>Cindy Loo Hoo handed Santa the soggy list. “It was… the mischievous snowball bandits!”</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>“Snowball bandits?!” Santa laughed. “Those tricky elves! Well, we can fix this! We’ll just dry out the list and make sure no one gets missed for Christmas.”</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>George, Cindy Loo Hoo, and Santa worked together, drying out the paper and making sure everything was back to normal.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>“Phew! We did it!” Cindy Loo Hoo said, tossing her hat in the air.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="page-padding">
            <p>“And we solved the mystery!” George added, doing a little dance.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>Santa smiled. “Thanks to you two, Christmas is saved! And you both get extra cookies and candy canes for your detective work.”</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>As they danced and giggled around Santa’s workshop, Cindy Loo Hoo raised her cup of chocolate milk. “To friendship, fries, and mystery-solving!”</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>“Sha-booya!” George cheered, and they laughed all the way until Christmas morning.</p>
