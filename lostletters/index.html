            <p>It was a quiet afternoon in the small town of Snowberry Hills, and the Christmas decorations were all in place. But something unexpected happened that would soon send everyone into a frantic scramble: a strong wind gusted through the town, swooping up Santa’s mailbag and scattering it far and wide.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>“Uh-oh! Look at that!” shouted Xmas, a preppy young elf who loved matching scarves and always had his shoes polished. He pointed to the flurry of letters flying through the air.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>“Oh my golly gumdrops!” Carols gasped, clutching her shiny red handbag. She was rich in spirit—and in glittery accessories—and she wasn’t about to let a little thing like a windstorm ruin Christmas. “The letters to Santa are everywhere! We have to get them back!”</p>

        <div class="page-padding">
            <p>Xmas and Carols quickly realized they had an important task ahead of them: collect all the scattered letters and deliver them to the North Pole before it was too late.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>“Let’s go!” Carols said, running toward the first group of letters that had landed in a nearby park. “We need to find these and make sure Santa gets them!”</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>Xmas, always well-prepared, grabbed a handful of brightly colored lollipops from his backpack. “These will help us focus,” he said, tossing one to Carols and popping one into his own mouth.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>The lollipops were delicious, but they didn’t slow them down. Instead, they gave them even more energy. The two raced through the town, catching flying letters and dodging snowdrifts.</p>

        <div class="page-padding">
            <p>“Oh my golly gumdrops, that letter almost went into the fountain!” Carols laughed, as she plucked a letter out of midair just in time. “Santa’s going to be so pleased we saved that one!”</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>“We can’t stop now, Carols!” Xmas shouted, as they dashed past the ice cream shop, where they found a letter stuck to the roof. “We’re on a roll! Let’s keep going!”</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>They ran down the streets, collecting the letters from the rooftops, trees, and even a snowman’s scarf. Carols was so quick that she even snatched a letter out of the hands of a curious squirrel. “Got it!” she said with a wink. “This little guy almost delivered it to the wrong place!”</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>“Oh my golly gumdrops, Carols!” Xmas said, laughing. “You’re on fire today!”</p>
        </div>

    <div>
        <div class="page-padding">
            <p>The two friends continued running through the town, getting closer and closer to the North Pole. They passed the bakery, the toy store, and even a snow-covered shopping mall. But something strange was happening: more and more letters kept appearing, as if they were multiplying!</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>“We need a plan, Carols!” Xmas said, panting.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>“I’ve got it!” Carols grinned. “We’ll go shopping! We’ll pick up all the letters at once!”</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>With their lollipops still in hand, they ran into the toy store, where they found a pile of letters stacked high on the counter. Then they dashed to the bakery and grabbed a stack of letters hidden behind a jar of candy canes. Everywhere they looked, there seemed to be more letters waiting to be found.</p>

        <div class="page-padding">
            <p>“Oh my golly gumdrops!” Xmas said, grabbing the last letter from the cookie jar. “How did they all get here?”</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>“We’re getting close to the North Pole now,” Carols said, checking her fancy gold wristwatch. “We can do this! Let’s finish strong!”</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>With one final burst of energy, they raced to the North Pole post office just in time. They were panting, but their arms were filled with letters.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>“We made it!” Xmas shouted as he slid into the North Pole mailbox.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>Carols grinned and pushed the last letter inside. “And just in time, too! Now Santa can get his letters and make Christmas magical for all the good boys and girls!”</p>

    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="page-padding">
            <p>Xmas clapped his hands. “Oh my golly gumdrops! That was the fastest letter delivery ever!”</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>Carols threw her arms around him. “And the most fun! I don’t think Santa’s ever had such an adventurous day before!”</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>As the wind died down and the snow began to fall gently over Snowberry Hills, Xmas and Carols looked up at the twinkling stars. They had saved Christmas, and it felt like the best present of all.</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>“Oh my golly gumdrops,” Carols said with a smile. “This was a Christmas we’ll never forget!”</p>
            <br/><br/>
            <p>“Yep,” Xmas agreed, giving her a high-five. “Best Christmas ever!”</p>
